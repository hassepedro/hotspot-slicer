  "readme": "node-red-node-smooth\n====================\n\nA <a href=\"http://nodered.org\" target=\"_new\">Node-RED</a> node that provides\nseveral simple smoothing algorithms for incoming data values. These include\n\n - Minimum\n - Maximum\n - Mean\n - Standard Deviation\n - High Pass Smoothing\n - Low Pass Smoothing\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nRun the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`\n\n    npm install node-red-node-smooth\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nA simple node to provide various functions across several previous values,\nincluding max, min, mean, standard deviation, high and low pass filters.\n\nMax, Min, Mean and Standard Deviation work over a rolling window, based on a\nspecified number of previous values.\n\nThe High and Low pass filters use a smoothing factor. The higher the number\nthe more the smoothing. E.g. a value of 10 is similar to an &alpha; of 0.1.\nIt is analogous to an RC time constant - but there is no time component to\nthis as the code is based on events arriving.\n\n**Note:** This node only operates on **numbers**. Anything else will try to be\nmade into a number and rejected if that fails.\n",
